# ShinyAppProject
This project aims to study the Air BNB housing market in NYC. NYC has experienced tremendous growth over the past several years and AirBNB
has become a viable alternative to consider when visiting a new location. Unfamiliarity with a city, and the sheer volumne of choices can
be overwhelming to somebody looking for a place to stay. This project had a goal of building an R shiny app that provides a quick comparison
between and quality and cost for people looking for an air BNB stay. This project also looks to explore the impact of subway lines
on the air BNB market by looking at the per foot distance cost of each subway line.
